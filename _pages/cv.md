Education
======
* B.A. in Applied Mathematics, University of California, Berkeley, 2018
* M.S. in Earth System Science, University of California, Irvine, 2022
* Ph.D in Earth System Science, University of California, Irvine, 2025 (expected)

Work experience
======
* Graduate Research Assistant @ Computational Clouds and Climate Lab (Sep 2020 - Present)
  * Increased sampling of hybrid physics-ML climate simulations by an order-of-magnitude to investigate which design decisions are most conducive to stably accurate coupled behavior and out-of-distribution coupled generalization.
  * Core contributor to ClimSim, which won the equivalent of the best paper award for the NeurIPS Datasets and Benchmarks Track.

* Graduate Research Assistant @ Berkeley Lab (Jun 2024 - Aug 2024)
  * Worked on improving asset-level wind power forecasts in joint partnership with Vayuh.ai

* Public Utilities Regulatory Analyst @ California Public Utilities Commission (Jan - Aug 2020)
  * Conducted hazard rate analysis for utility infrastructure that formed part of CPUC's counterproposal for Southern California Edison's proposed energy rate hikes

* Intern @ California Public Utilities Commission (Summer 2017): 
  * Created a flexible machine learning pipeline for predicitng which customers would be most at risk of defaulting on utility bills
  * Co-led workshops to teach employees how to use R and take over projects I participated in after I left
  * Created standards for future data submission from California utilities

* National Bureau of Economic Research funded Research Assistant (Summer 2016)
  * Created a database of lawyers and law firms specializing in disability insurance with web scraping tools created in R

Other
=======
Was briefly interested in devising a voting strategy that took the best parts of plurality and approval voting and generalized them as a "First Choice Weighted Approval Voting System," and I wrote a preprint of the work with my good friend Peter Butler, which can be found [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341816279_Evaluating_the_Properties_of_a_First_Choice_Weighted_Approval_Voting_System#fullTextFileContent).
