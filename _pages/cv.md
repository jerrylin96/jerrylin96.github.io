Education
======
* B.A. in Applied Mathematics, University of California, Berkeley, 2018
* M.S. in Earth System Science, University of California, Irvine, 2022
* Ph.D in Earth System Science, University of California, Irvine, 2025 (expected)

Work experience
======
* Graduate Research Assistant @ Computational Clouds and Climate Lab (Sep 2020 - Present)
  * Currently working on uncertainty calibration for stochastic neural network parameterizations
  * Increased sampling of hybrid physics-ML climate simulations by an order-of-magnitude to investigate which design decisions are most conducive to stably accurate coupled behavior and out-of-distribution coupled generalization.
  * Core contributor to ClimSim, which won the equivalent of the best paper award for the NeurIPS Datasets and Benchmarks Track.

* Public Utilities Regulatory Analyst @ California Public Utilities Commission (Jan - Aug 2020)
  * Conducted hazard rate analysis for utility infrastructure that formed part of CPUC's counterproposal for Southern California Edison's proposed energy rate hikes

* Intern @ California Public Utilities Commission (Summer 2017): 
  * Created a flexible machine learning pipeline for predicitng which customers would be most at risk of defaulting on utility bills
  * Co-led workshops to teach employees how to use R and take over projects I participated in after I left
  * Created standards for future data submission from California utilities

* National Bureau of Economic Research funded Research Assistant (Summer 2016)
  * Created a database of lawyers and law firms specializing in disability insurance with web scraping tools created in R

Other

Was briefly interested in devising a voting strategy that took the best parts of plurality and approval voting and generalized them as a "First Choice Weighted Approval Voting System," and I wrote a preprint of the work with my good friend Peter Butler, which can be found here:

This work was done under the supervision of UC Berkeley math professor Nikhil Srivastava. If you would like to extend this work and publish it somewhere or find it somewhat interesting, please feel free to reach out! I will not be able to personally dedicate a lot of time to it, however.
